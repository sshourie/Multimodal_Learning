# A Study of Multimodal Architectures for improving non-English Classification

Course project for CS 7643

### Abstract
Natural language processing (NLP) innovations have completely changed how scholars and practitioners approach important societal issues. Modern approaches for text recognition and classification applications are now based on large language models. However, the development of advanced computational techniques and resources is disproportionately concentrated on the English language, sidelining most of the languages used in the world. While prior work has improved multilingual and monolingual models, we investigate the potential of multimodal machine learning to close the performance gap between English and non-English languages by incorporating the features captured in images. We focus on the crisis-information dataset and  show that adding image modality to non-English (Hindi in our case) text embeddings does improve upon the downstream classification task.
